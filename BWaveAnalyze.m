function [ output_args ] = BWaveAnalyze( input_args )
%analyzes operations like fft for percentages of brainwaves present by
%performing integral of frequency bandwith respective to each b-wave,
%adding them to form a total value, then dividing each value by the total
%to find the percentage of each b-wave present

%NOTE Best for looking at general presences over an entire signal since fft
%does not include time variable, ie more alpha than beta present in ENTIRE
%signal
